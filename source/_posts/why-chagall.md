I just finished my thesis about Chagall's market, collectors and symbols. During my research, I found that the top lot of Christie's 20th Century & Contemporary Art evening sale in Shanghai, Les Mariés (1979), became a bought-in. And, it's a Chagall. I was astounded - according to my research the market demand for Chagall’s paintings has been high historically. How come a top lot was not sold? The pre-sale media campaign also put this work under spotlight.

Before talking about why, I list several common characteristics of an expensive Chagall's painting on auction market:

*  Medium: oil on canvas
*  Motif: bouquets and flying lovers
*  Size: the larger the better
*  Year: produced before 1941 is more expensive (because he painted more after that); the works painted between the 1910s and the 1940s are the most sought-after.

Now let's look at this work. The price is estimated between US$ 2.5 – 3.5 million. It's a tempera-on-masonite executed in the artist’s later years – 1979. These could be deal breakers, at least for a top lot Chagall painting. Chagall is well known as a prolific artist; that means the market supply of his paintings is high. In the art world, oil paintings are usually more sought-after and more expensive than a similar painting in other mediums. This rule should at least apply to the modern masters. The bright side is it has Chagall’s signature flowers and lovers. Looking at the most expensive works sold on auctions, I found that the market loves enlarged bouquets dominating the canvas. Unfortunately, Les Mariés is not one of them.

Here is the question: why would a collector want to pay US$ 2.5 – 3.5 million for a market-wise mediocre Chagall painting? It is not a rare work: not the best year; not the best medium; boring provenance and no exhibition history. It is certainly not a starry work from Chagall. Meanwhile, the Chinese market for Impressionist and Modern art might be over-estimated.  Chinese collectors are expected to repeat the Impressionist boom that Japanese created in the 1990s, especially with the story of Modigliani’s Reclining Nude. After knowing that this top lot failed to sell, I sense Chinese collectors are informed and sensible. And don't forget, if this painting was hammered and eventually imported into China, 17% VAT would be added to the total price.

Market mechanism is hard to fully understand. But after all, the market always favors rare works. In a recent auction at Sotheby's New York, Chagall's PORTRAIT DE LA SOEUR DE L’ARTISTE (1908) fetched US$ 852,500. That was the first I saw a Chagall painting in auction houses which was executed before 1910. Despite the motif is not iconic, Chagall’s skill was not refined yet, and the size is small (25 x 21 in. 63.5 x 53.3 cm), the realized price is close to a million.

If a paintings isn’t that special and the market doesn't overheat, we see artwork fails to sell. But when it comes to a top lot, I wonder if it is a fault of marketing strategy.
